# BNC
1) What is the BNC [https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/]?
The British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of British English from the later part of the 20th century, both spoken and written. The latest edition is the BNC XML Edition, released in 2007. (90% written, 10% orthographically transcribed spoken text)

The written part of the BNC (90%) includes, for example, extracts from regional and national newspapers, specialist periodicals and journals for all ages and interests, academic books and popular fiction, published and unpublished letters and memoranda, school and university essays, among many other kinds of text. The spoken part (10%) consists of orthographic transcriptions of unscripted informal conversations (recorded by volunteers selected from different age, region and social classes in a demographically balanced way) and spoken language collected in different contexts, ranging from formal business or government meetings to radio shows and phone-ins.

2) What sort of corpus is the BNC?
- Monolingual: It deals with modern British English, not other languages used in Britain. However non-British English and foreign language words do occur in the corpus.

- Synchronic: It covers British English of the late twentieth century, rather than the historical development which produced it.

- General: It includes many different styles and varieties, and is not limited to any particular subject field, genre or register. In particular, it contains examples of both spoken and written language.

- Sample: For written sources, samples of 45,000 words are taken from various parts of single-author texts. Shorter texts up to a maximum of 45,000 words, or multi-author texts such as magazines and newspapers, are included in full. Sampling allows for a wider coverage of texts within the 100 million limit, and avoids over-representing idiosyncratic texts.

Full reference information about the BNC is provided in the Reference Guide for the British National Corpus (XML Edition). Information about the BNC project and the original creation of the corpus can be found at corpus creation page. The corpus can be downloaded from the OTA.

- BNC Baby

BNC Baby is a subset of the BNC. It consists of four one-million word samples, each compiled as an example of a particular genre: fiction, newspapers, academic writing and spoken conversation. The texts have the same annotation as the full corpus (part of speech, meta data, etc). The Reference Guide to BNC Baby [.pdf file] offers further information about this sample, such as a description of the design and information about the way in which it is encoded.
The BNC Baby is in XML format. More information about the former release of BNC Baby on CD is available on the BNC Baby CD page. Nowadays, the corpus can be downloaded from the OTA.

- BNC Sampler
The BNC Sampler is a subset of the full BNC. It comprises two samples of written and spoken material of one million words each, compiled to mirror the composition of the full BNC as far as possible. The word-class annotation of the BNC Sampler texts has been carefully checked and manually corrected. The Sampler was first created at Lancaster University during the creation of the BNC. More information about the Sampler can be found in the users reference guide for the BNC Sampler: XML Edition
